            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The project began with recognizing a common issue: people often experience symptoms and want quick 
                answers about their health concerns. It can be challenging to differentiate between various diseases, 
                especially when symptoms overlap. Our goal was to provide a convenient solution for users to input 
                their symptoms and receive potential diagnoses.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>
                We developed a web app that allows users to enter a list of symptoms they are experiencing. The app 
                then uses a pre-trained Decision Tree Classifier model to predict the most likely disease based on the 
                provided symptoms. Here's how it works:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Symptom Input:</b> Users enter their symptoms through a user-friendly interface. The web app 
                    supports a wide range of symptoms, making it versatile for different scenarios.</li>
                <li><b>Machine Learning Model:</b> We trained a Decision Tree Classifier using a dataset containing 
                    symptoms and corresponding diseases. The model is capable of predicting diseases based on input 
                    symptoms.</li>
                <li><b>Prediction:</b> The app uses the model to predict the most likely disease, providing users 
                    with instant information about potential health concerns.</li>
                <li><b>Additional Information:</b> To enhance user experience, the app also provides additional 
                    information about the predicted disease, including a description of the disease, recommended 
                    precautions, medications, dietary advice, and workout tips.</li>
            </ol>
